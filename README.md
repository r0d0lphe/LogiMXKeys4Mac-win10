# LogiMXKeys4Mac-win10

I've been looking for a long time for a solution to fully use my Logitech MX Keys for Mac keyboard on Windows 10. I had found a few solutions, which I'll detail below, but none of them were really useful. And above all, I still had a keyboard mapping problem for the < and @ keys (french keyboard).

So I modified the French - Apple keyboard mapping provided by Microsoft to adapt it to my needs.

I hope you will find this useful and that it will meet your needs, as it is difficult to find a Logitech MX Keys For Mac driver that works for Windows and is adapted to French keyboards.

## Some acceptable but not satisfying solutions

  - Phocean.net French Apple MacBook Keyboard Layout for Windows (https://archive.phocean.net/tools/french-apple-macbook-keyboard-layout-for-windows.html)
> It works, but I still have a problem with the @ and < keys
  - Vincent Deniau's blog (https://blog.vincentdeniau.fr/articles/utiliser-clavier-apple-windows)
> Same remark as above

## The solution that works for me

  - Copy the file "French-Apple-FR-ISO.zip" to your Windows 10 machine.
  - Unzip the file
  - Run the "setup.exe" program located in the "French-Apple-FR-ISO" directory
  - Go to the language settings ("Paramètre" > "Heure et Langue" > "Langue")
