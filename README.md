# LogiMXKeys4Mac-win10

I've been looking for a long time for a solution to fully use my Logitech MX Keys for Mac keyboard on Windows 10. I had found a few solutions, which I'll detail below, but none of them were really useful. And above all, I still had a keyboard mapping problem for the < and @ keys (French keyboard).

So I modified the French - Apple keyboard mapping provided by Microsoft to adapt it to my needs.

I hope you will find this useful and that it will meet your needs, as it is difficult to find a Logitech MX Keys For Mac driver that works for Windows and is adapted to French keyboards.
